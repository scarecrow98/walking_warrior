1. Make a row or column of 3 identical cells to get points.
2. Make a row or column of 4 identical cells to get extra points and a bonus cell. Bonus cells look like normal cells in circle.
3. Make a row or column of 3 identical cells containing a bonus cell to get extra moves.
4. Make matches in the shape of T or L to get potassium or magnesium.
Other moves:
5. Click potassium when you want to clear a row of cells
6. Click magnesium when you want to clear a column of cells
7. Click the switch button to switch two cells without creating a match (this costs 3 moves)
8. Click the X button to erase a cell (this costs 2 moves)
9. After level 3, you must walk 500 steps. There are additional  steps required to be taken for higher levels.
